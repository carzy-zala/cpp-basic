 ->polymorphism mean having many forms of one thing

 It has two type
  1.Compile time polymorphism

   //it also known as early binding or static polymorphism
     1.1. Function Overloading
     1.2. Operator Overloading
    
  2.Run time polymorphism
    //it can archieved through the
    //Also called as the late binding 
    //It doesn't mean that we can't predict the which function bind to programme it stands that in actual compiler during run time it associate function so it is called the run time polymorphism
