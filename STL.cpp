/*
----------------- STL ---------------
- It stand for standard template library
- It is collection of the some predefined templates in c++
- We have to use it because it saves time and increas code reusability
- It is combinatin of 
       1.Container -it store data 
                    it is objects and class of template for ex//list,vector
       2.Algorithm - 
                     it process the template function  for ex // sorting,searching  
       3.Iterators - it is basically object to the element of the template
                      we can use it as the pointer but actually it is object
                   - it conect container and algorithm                  
    
------------ Containers ---------------
- three types of container 
   1.sequencial
   2.associative
   3.dynamic

auto is keyword that reduce step of variable declaration of the variable
like ,

           line if we direct start use of ptr by
